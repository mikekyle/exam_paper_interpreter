Creating a project to bring together some work I've done previously on pulling text from actuarial past papers for analysis.
Example uses include:
- Identifying trends in question content.
- Understanding clusters/types of questions that are possible/frequent.
- Classifying/Labelling questions eg. by chapter.
- Fitting a model to predict my own performance on a question.
- Identifying topics/clusters/chapters that I find more challenging and need to study more deeply.

Some of this work has been done previously in ad hoc notebooks. This project aims to formalise some of these tools and add further tools.
