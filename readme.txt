Creating a project to bring together some work I've done previously on pulling text from actuarial past papers for analysis.
Example uses include:
- Identifying trends in question content.
- Understanding clusters/types of questions that are possible/frequent.
- Classifying/Labelling questions eg. by chapter.
- Fitting a model to predict my own performance on a question.
- Identifying topics/clusters/chapters that I find more challenging and need to study more deeply.
